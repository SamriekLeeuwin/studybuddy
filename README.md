# StudyBuddy

StudyBuddy is a project I started to help students (like myself) stay organized, plan their work, and keep up motivation. The idea goes beyond just managing a to-do list. The app will let you upload your homework (as a photo or PDF), automatically recognize what's in it, and create a study plan for you. It will then ask you simple, helpful questions each day to keep you on track—or help you adjust your plan if needed.

I'm building this project as part of my portfolio. The backend is written in Java. The frontend is still in development.

## Why this project?

As a student, I know how easy it is to feel overwhelmed by deadlines and lose focus. I wanted to create something that actually helps—not just track tasks, but think ahead, suggest better planning, and give small daily check-ins to stay motivated. StudyBuddy is my way of combining technical skills with a real-life problem I experience myself.
