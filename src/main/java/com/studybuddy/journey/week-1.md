#  Week 1 – Laying the Foundation

This week I focused on setting up the base for my project, **StudyBuddy**.  
I didn’t build many features yet — my goal was to create a clean structure that I can build on in the next weeks.

---

##  What I Did

-  Created the main project folders:
    - `controller/`
    - `service/`
    - `repository/`
    - `model/`
    - `dto/`
    - `config/`
    - `security/`
-  Built the first entity: `User`
-  Designed a UML diagram to plan out the main parts of the system
-  Wrote the first version of the `README.md`
-  Cleaned up the file structure and committed everything to GitHub

##  What I Learned

- The importance of having a clean project structure from the start
- How to organize logic using layers (`controller → service → repository`)
- That planning (like UML) saves time and helps me think more clearly
- How to set up a Java Spring Boot project

##  Thoughts

I didn’t jump straight into building features — and I’m glad I didn’t.  
It felt good to take a step back, plan things out, and set up the foundation properly.

**Next week:** I want to start working on the `Task` entity and the first real endpoints for the app.
